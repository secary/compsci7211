## Question 14(8 Points)

Retrieve the branch update1 from the remote server and switch to it.
After you've tested and verified your commands, save the commands (excluding the clone command) in a file named question14.sh

 

Hints:

Cloning the repository will retrieve the main branch only; you will need to take additional steps to retrieve other branches.
After having pushed your local to remote, please double check whether the necessary files/directories are in place under your github account. eg. file1 should be existed with git-practice-01.
Question 15(8 Points)

Resolve any merge conflicts
Copy any files that you needed to manually resolve merge conflicts for, and add the merged versions of those files to your submission alongside  your .sh files.

 

Hints:

Cloning the repository will retrieve the main branch only; you will need to take additional steps to retrieve other branches.
Review the contents of affected files to determine how to resolve any merge conflicts; the file contents for this activity will indicate what should be done.
